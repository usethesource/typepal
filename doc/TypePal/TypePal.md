#### Synopsis

TypePal is a framework for name analysis, type checking and type inference

#### Usage
  
#### Description

Many type checkers have already been written in Rascal with good results. However, type checkers for different languages have a lot in common and address similar
questions:

* How to handle declarations of names, in particular their scope and uses?
* How to distinguish the roles names can play, e.g., names of functions, data types, labels, constants or variables?
* How to handle imports and multiple name spaces?
* How to associate requirements/constraints relevant for type checking with the syntax definition of the language being type checked?
* How to represent the types that occur in a program?
* How to handle global or local type inference?
* How to handle overloading?
* How to give precise error messages (and avoid spurious messages)?
* How to extract information that is useful for later compiler stages or the IDE for, 
  e.g., code generation, use-def information or name completion?
  
TypePal is a Rascal framework that addresses the above questions and we describe here all its concepts, architecture and features
and also show some examples:
